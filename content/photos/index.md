I am a thoroughly amateur photographer with no special training or equipment, but do enjoy taking photographs, especially while on outdoor adventures.  Here are a few random ones that have caught my eye over the years.  This page/section is a work in progress; photos will be added, and they may or may not become more organized over time.
