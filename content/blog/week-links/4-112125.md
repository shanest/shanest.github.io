First, I've got a confession to make.  I actually missed not one but _two_ days of [daily blogging](post-a-day.md) this week.  Although I back-filled yesterday, I didn't write on either Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  I've got plenty of excuses lined up, but mainly I just let work / life get in the way.  Luckily, I made some progress on some academic writing projects in the spare writing time that I did have, so that also feels like appropriate prioritization.  \*pats self on back\*

In this week's episode of "if you build it, they will come" applied to urban design: after Iowa City made its buses free, [traffic cleared and air quality improved](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/climate/iowa-city-free-buses.html?unlocked_article_code=1.2U8.ikg9.G_8g-6-gYeyM).  You love to see it.

Closer to home, Kirkland^[Yes, of Costco's Kirkland Signature fame.] [voters elected a city council](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/11/21/kirkland-voters-reject-anti-growth-push/) set on continuing plans for growth and building more housing against a NIMBY opposition group.

In the latest round of codified thought policing from the Republican party, "[Texas A&M systematizes massive violation of core academic freedom rights of faculty](https://leiterreports.com/2025/11/17/texas-am-systematizes-massive-violation-of-core-academic-freedom-rights-of-faculty/)".

I'm officially old.  Dictionary.com's word of the year was "6-7".  Having no idea what that was or meant, I had to rely on [this post from Language Log](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=71991) to point me to [this explainer from WHYY](https://whyy.org/articles/meaning-6-7-skrilla-philadelphia/), Philadelphia's local NPR station.    I guess it's just the cycle of life.

I'm looking forward to watching [this feature length documentary on the history of rail trails for bicycling](https://bikepacking.com/news/from-rails-to-trails-documentary/) soon.  Of course, while I love these rail trails---and commute on one of the earliest in the country every day---I also wish we could have rails _and_ trails.

Here's [an interview](https://newrepublic.com/article/202433/happened-effective-altruism) with the author of a new book on effective altruism.^[Provocatively titled _Death in a Shallow Pond_]  Not the most illuminating thing I've ever read, but a useful overview of some of the history.

My colleague Noah Smith will become a Vice Provost for Artificial Intelligence after [a $10M donation](https://www.washington.edu/news/2025/11/18/10-million-gift-from-charles-and-lisa-simonyi-establishes-aiuw-to-advance-artificial-intelligence-and-emerging-technologies/).
