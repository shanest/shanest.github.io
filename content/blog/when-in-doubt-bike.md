Bicycling has long been part of my life.  My dad was an avid cyclist, who spent most weekends going on long rides with friends^[Usually with a food destination in mind.] before regaling us with a slide show of their exploits.  He'd also semi-regularly take cycling trips.  Although I didn't catch the cycling bug to quite the degree he'd have liked me to,^[Disc golf was my obsession during my teenage years.  Granted, I would ride my bike to the course after school regularly.] we still did go on a wonderful trip to Scotland when I was 15 or 16.  

Despite that, I have always owned a bike and always regularly ridden one.  From Baltimore, to Palo Alto, to Amsterdam, and now to Seattle, I've been very fortunate to always commute by bike (with a public transit recourse when needed).  And I have always done the occasional long ride as well.^[More on some loooong rides this past summer at some point in the trip reports section.]

It's the time of year where [The Big Grey](https://www.cascadepbs.org/news/2024/10/big-dark-how-washingtonians-weather-gloom-gray/) has recently taken over in Seattle and, with it, the debate on when to hop on the bike versus when to ride a bus (or even---gasp---drive).  Since I'm on sabbatical at the moment, that debate is happening less often.

Last night, however, I was heading out for a social gathering at a local brewery.  It had already been dark for an hour, it was raining off and on all day, and I was pretty tired physically and mentally.  Very tempting conditions to be "lazy" and take the bus.

But I decided to use the occasion to put [the roll-up fenders](https://musguard.com/) on the bike, turn on the lights, and get a few miles in.  It was lovely!  There's something very meditative about coasting through the wet, leafy, reflective roads with the hood of your rain-jacket pulled over your helmet.^[Living in Amsterdam was good prep on how to be prepared for riding in the rain, with a shell, pants, gloves.]  I feel like I'm in a little moving cocoon, just me, myself, and the breath moving through the world; partially, but not fully, exposed to the elements.

It was a small act, but I was so happy to be riding instead of inside a vehicle.  It was my annual reminder of a truth that I've learned many times while riding in the rain in Seattle: I never regret riding instead of a different mode.

When in doubt, ride the bike.
