Starting today, I will write one blog post a day through the month of November.^[November 1 was a Saturday, so I'm starting on the first weekday.]  Why?  I've often given the standard daily-writing advice to many people, including my students, but have not often followed it myself---a fact that I am upfront about with anyone to whom I dole it out.  Relatedly, I am on sabbatical right now, but have found myself failing to carve out the kind of intentional writing time that is exactly what such a break is designed for.  The hope is that this low-stakes daily-writing practice will "grease the groove" and get me back in the habit of all forms of writing.

Why now?  It happens to coincide with [The Inkhaven Residency](https://www.inkhaven.blog/), a fellowship where bloggers apply and commit to a residential program with daily blog posts.  Although I'm not wild about the Rationalist world that sponors and runs the program,^[It takes place at the [Lighthaven](https://www.lighthaven.space/) complex, which you can read more about in [this New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/technology/rationalists-ai-lighthaven.html).] I do like the emphasis on a steady practice for honing the craft of writing.  You are what you repeatedly do, and I am not happy with the lack of consistent writing in my life.  The timing is also perfect: I just returned from two trips in October^[Most recently, [a colloquium at Georgetown](https://linguistics.georgetown.edu/events/friday-speaker-series/).] and have a lighter travel calendar in November.  Seemed serendipitous.

Some parameters for myself:
- Aim for 500 words daily.  This will be rough though.  I am not a believer in length minimums, since one cannot prejudge the length required to adequatly express a given thought.  That being said: I want to express some non-trivial thought daily.  A single link with a one-sentence comment would be too thin.  Similarly: more than one post a day is also allowed.
- Only on weekdays.  Enough said.  Regular practice is important, but so is balance, and I have other activities I want to do on the weekends.
- No full pre-writing.  While I see the value in doing this, and have taken random notes about things I'd like to write,^[For instance, some [retroactive trip reports](../trip-reports.md#coming-in-the-future).] my goal is not to have produced X number of posts for this website.  My goal is to cultivate a daily writing practice.  The process, not the output, is what matters for me.^[Why post at all then?  Accountability's a hell of a drug.]
- Content: no promises at all.  Some posts will be quasi-academic, some will be link collections, and most I have no idea what they will be.

With that out of the way: écrivons!
