Starting in 2020, I began keeping track of all of the books I read, a habit I adapted from my brother.  Starting in 2023, I jotted down a quick long-paragraph review (with a "grade") of each book as well.  Here's the list of books I read in 2025, in reverse chronological order.  The year ended with a bit of a whimper; I spent November and December partially reading six or so books in parallel (*gritting teeth emoji here*), which I promise to finish before too long.  I still at least hit my rough goal of a book a month, averaged across the year.
